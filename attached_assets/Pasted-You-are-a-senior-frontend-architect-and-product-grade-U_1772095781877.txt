You are a senior frontend architect and product-grade UI engineer.

Your task is to design and build a production-level, premium frontend for the following backend microservices project:

Repository:
https://github.com/nampallyharish4/Ecom-MicroServices.git

1. First — Understand the Backend (MANDATORY)

Analyze the repository deeply and extract:

All microservices and their responsibilities

API Gateway routes

Authentication & authorization flow (JWT / OAuth / Session etc.)

Service-to-service communication (REST / Kafka / RabbitMQ / Events / Saga if exists)

Database per service and data ownership

Product, Cart, Order, Payment, User domain models

Error handling & response formats

API request/response contracts

Generate a clear backend map before building UI.

2. Frontend Goal

Build a Premium E-Commerce Website focused on:

Shoes (Primary category)

Men’s Wear (Secondary category)

Target feel:
Luxury / Premium / Minimal / Clean / Fast / Modern

Think: Nike / Zara / Adidas / Apple-level UI polish.

3. Tech Requirements

Use modern production stack:

React (Next.js preferred)

TypeScript

Tailwind or Styled Components

Responsive (Mobile + Desktop)

API integration with backend microservices

JWT Auth integration

State management (Redux Toolkit / Zustand / React Query)

Optimized performance (lazy loading, caching)

Clean architecture

4. Core Features to Implement
User Features

Signup / Login / JWT Auth

Profile management

Address management

Product Features

Category browsing (Shoes / Mens Wear)

Smart filters (Size, Price, Brand, Color)

Search

Product detail page (premium layout)

Cart & Checkout

Add / Remove / Update cart

Real-time price calculation

Coupon support (if backend supports)

Order placement

Payment flow (mock if payment service incomplete)

Orders

Order history

Order tracking UI

Status timeline

5. Premium UI Requirements

Design must feel high-end, not generic.

Include:

Large hero banner

Clean typography

High contrast product cards

Smooth animations

Micro-interactions

Skeleton loading

Elegant empty states

Sticky header with search

Luxury dark/light theme option

6. Pages Required

Home (Premium showcase)

Shoes Category

Mens Wear Category

Product Detail

Cart

Checkout

Orders

Login / Signup

Profile

Error / 404

Loading states

7. Engineering Expectations

Follow real production standards:

Clean folder structure

Reusable components

API layer abstraction

Error boundaries

Environment config

Secure token handling

Scalable architecture

Comment major logic

README with run instructions

8. Deliverables

Provide:

Frontend architecture diagram

Folder structure

UI wireframe explanation

API integration mapping (Frontend ↔ Microservices)

Full working frontend code

Instructions to run locally

Suggestions to improve UX + performance

9. Quality Level

This is not a basic UI.
Build like a funded startup / FAANG-level frontend.

Focus on:

Performance

UX polish

Scalability

Clean engineering

Real production readiness

If backend endpoints are unclear, infer logically from service design and create clean API contracts.
